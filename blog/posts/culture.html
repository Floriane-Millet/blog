            <p>
                When I first arrived in Osijek, I honestly didn't know what to expect. Croatia
                was never on my initial Erasmus wish list, but looking back now after three months,
                I can confidently say it was one of the best "accidents" of my life. The cultural
                richness of this city has completely surprised me.
            </p>

            <h2>Tvrđa: A Walk Through History</h2>

            <p>
                The heart of Osijek's cultural identity is undoubtedly <strong>Tvrđa</strong>, the
                18th-century baroque fortress. Unlike many European cities where historic centers
                feel like open-air museums, Tvrđa is vibrantly alive. Students rush between lectures
                at the various university faculties housed in the old baroque buildings, couples sip
                coffee at charming outdoor cafés, and locals stroll through cobblestone streets as
                if walking through history is the most natural thing in the world.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>💡 Must-Visit in Tvrđa</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Church of St. Michael:</strong> Stunning baroque architecture</li>
                    <li><strong>Main Square (Trg Svetog Trojstva):</strong> Perfect for people-watching</li>
                    <li><strong>Museum of Slavonia:</strong> Free entry for students!</li>
                    <li><strong>Evening walks:</strong> The fortress is beautifully lit at night</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Living Architecture</h2>

            <p>
                What fascinates me most about Osijek is how the city layers different historical
                periods. You have the baroque grandeur of Tvrđa, the Austro-Hungarian elegance
                of the Upper Town (Gornji Grad), and modern developments all coexisting
                harmoniously. The <strong>Water Tower</strong> and the <strong>European Avenue</strong>
                showcase beautiful Secession (Art Nouveau) architecture that rivals anything you'd
                find in Vienna or Budapest.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pro tip: Rent a bike and spend an afternoon just riding through different
                neighborhoods. The architectural diversity tells the story of Osijek better than
                any guidebook.
            </p>

            <h2>Croatian Cultural Calendar</h2>

            <p>
                One of the unexpected joys has been experiencing Croatian festivals and traditions.
                Here are some highlights from my time here:
            </p>

            <h3>Osijek Summer Nights (Ljeto na Trgu)</h3>
            <p>
                During summer, the main square transforms into an open-air cultural venue.
                Concerts, theater performances, and art exhibitions happen almost every night.
                It's free, it's vibrant, and it's the perfect way to meet both locals and other
                international students.
            </p>

            <h3>St. Martin's Day (Martinje)</h3>
            <p>
                November 11th marks the celebration of young wine becoming "real" wine. Croatians
                take their wine seriously (Slavonia is a major wine region!), and this festival is
                a beautiful introduction to local wine culture. Many restaurants offer special
                menus, and there are wine tastings throughout the city.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Culture isn't something you observe from the outside here. In Osijek, you're
                invited to participate, to become part of it. That's what makes it special."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Kulin Connection</h2>

            <p>
                You can't talk about Croatian culture in Osijek without mentioning
                <strong>kulin</strong> – the region's famous spicy sausage. It's not just food;
                it's cultural heritage. Protected by EU geographical indication (like Champagne
                or Parma Ham), kulin represents Slavonian identity.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've had kulin at student gatherings, formal dinners, and even as a midnight snack.
                Each family has their own recipe (or sworn allegiance to a particular producer).
                Debates about the best kulin can get surprisingly passionate – it's like watching
                people argue about pizza in Italy!
            </p>

            <h2>Music and Arts Scene</h2>

            <p>
                For a city of 100,000, Osijek punches well above its weight culturally:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Croatian National Theatre Osijek:</strong> Regular performances of
                    drama, ballet, and opera at student-friendly prices (€5-10 with student ID)</li>
                <li><strong>Contemporary Art Gallery:</strong> Rotating exhibitions showcasing
                    Croatian and international artists</li>
                <li><strong>Indie Music Venues:</strong> Stara Pljara and other venues host
                    local and regional bands</li>
                <li><strong>Student Theatre Groups:</strong> Always looking for participants,
                    even if you don't speak Croatian!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Drava River: Natural Culture</h2>

            <p>
                Croatian culture isn't just about buildings and traditions – it's deeply connected
                to nature. The <strong>Drava River</strong> that flows through Osijek isn't just
                a geographic feature; it's central to local identity. Weekend barbecues along the
                river, sunset walks on the promenade, and summer swimming spots are all part of
                the cultural fabric.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just 10km away, <strong>Kopački Rit Nature Park</strong> is one of Europe's
                largest wetland reserves. It's a UNESCO biosphere reserve and a point of pride
                for locals. Going there with Croatian friends, you realize that their respect
                for nature is culturally ingrained.
            </p>

            <h2>Cultural Surprises</h2>

            <p>Here are some cultural quirks I've discovered:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coffee culture is serious:</strong> Croatians don't grab coffee
                    to-go. They sit, relax, and often spend hours chatting over a single coffee.</li>
                <li><strong>Patriotism is strong:</strong> Croatians are very proud of their
                    independence (gained in 1991) and their culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Time is relative:</strong> "Croatian time" is real. If someone says
                    they'll meet you at 2 PM, 2:15 is perfectly acceptable!</li>
                <li><strong>Family matters:</strong> Sundays are for family. Many shops close,
                    and you'll see multi-generational gatherings everywhere.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Takeaway</h2>

            <p>
                Discovering Croatian culture in Osijek has been like peeling an onion – there's
                always another layer. What started as curiosity about baroque architecture has
                evolved into genuine appreciation for a culture that balances tradition with
                modernity, formality with warmth, and local pride with hospitality to foreigners.
            </p>

            <p>
                My advice? Don't just visit the tourist sites. Attend a local festival, strike up
                conversations with elderly people in cafés (many speak German or English), join
                university cultural groups, and say yes when invited to someone's home for dinner.
                That's where the real culture lives.
            </p>
